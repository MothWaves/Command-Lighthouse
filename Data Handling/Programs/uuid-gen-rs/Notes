Roadmap:

- Add proper options parsing, potentially with getopts crate (yes, with getopts crate).
- Make tool generate other versions of uuid.

Apparently linux-utils already comes with a C version of this program. However, it does have some differences and doesn't support certain UUID versions, so I will still continue this project.
Might move this to it's own repository?
