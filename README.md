# The Command Lighthouse
This is my own collection of custom-made terminal-oriented tools, hereby referred to as the "Lighthouse". The collection is mostly made up of shell scripts and small programs.

Most of these are just hacky solutions to very specific problems that I'm putting here to convince myself the time I waste on automating the issue rather than just brute-forcing it is well worth it and that one day I will have to deal with the same issue and finally all the sunk cost put into various automation scripts will be worth it.

As such, don't expect anything too robust or useful or stable from this repository.

# Examples of Available Tools
- compare-strings: A shell script that compares two strings.
- uuid-gen-rs: A uuid generator for the command line, built on Rust (Currently only works with uuid v4).

# Purpose
Is this project useful? Probably not for most people. This project is a collection of tools that I have hacked together for my own use and have decided to share and host online. My workflow might be...unorthodox and in a lot of ways probably very inefficient and the tools here might reflect that. That being said, I hope if you do find this project maybe some of these tools can help you too.

# Project Structure
The Lighthouse is separated into a three-level directory tree. The first level categorizes the tools based on their utility (Ex: Cryptography, Development, etc...). The second level, separates the tools based on the type of tool (Ex: Scripts, Programs, etc...). The third level contains the individual projects. 

See the SEAFARER-GUIDE for more information on each directory.
You can also see the MANIFEST for a listing and description of every single project in the lighthouse.
