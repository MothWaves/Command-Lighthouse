# The Command Lighthouse
The guiding light to terminal usage.

This is my own collection of custom-made terminal-oriented tools, hereby referred to as the "Lighthouse". The collection is mostly made up of shell scripts and small programs.

Most of these are pretty minimalistic and are simply hacked together to make certain actions easier. 

# Examples of Available Tools
- comparestrings.sh: A shell script that compares two strings.

# Installation
Currently I don't have a installation program setup, I intend to make a customizable installation wizard, the code of which will also be available in the repository. For now, the user must manually move the desired scripts into a PATH accessible directory and must manually compile programs.

# Project Structure
The Lighthouse is separated into a three-level directory tree. The first level categorizes the tools based on their utility (Ex: Cryptography, Development, etc...). The second level, separates the tools based on the type of tool (Ex: Scripts, Programs, etc...). The third level contains the individual projects. 

See the SEAFARER-GUIDE for more information on each directory.
